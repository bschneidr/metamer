## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Added DOI of Matejka & Fitzmaurice (2017) in description. 

## Test environments

* local elementary OS Loki (ubuntu 16.04), R 3.5.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel, release and oldrelease)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* This is a new release.
* 1 note in win oldrelease: "Author field differs from that derived from Authors@R". Seems to be related to the way the ORCID id parses to a full URL.
